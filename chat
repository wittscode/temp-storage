When you say **AI search UX**, there are a few directions it can mean — product search (like e-commerce), enterprise knowledge base search, or AI-powered semantic search assistants. The "best" UX patterns tend to balance **user control, transparency, and speed**. Here are the most effective ones across contexts:

----------

### 🔎 Core AI Search UX Principles

1.  **Progressive disclosure**
    
    -   Start simple with a single input box.
        
    -   Expand into filters, facets, or clarifying questions only if the AI detects ambiguity.
        
2.  **Conversational refinement**
    
    -   Instead of showing only a static list of results, allow follow-up queries (“show only ones under $500” → system refines without retyping).
        
    -   Think **Chat + Search hybrid**.
        
3.  **Explainability**
    
    -   Highlight _why_ results were shown (matched keywords, semantic similarity, past behavior).
        
    -   Use “because you searched for…” or “similar to…” cues.
        
4.  **Trust & control**
    
    -   Provide options to toggle between “AI summarized” vs. “Raw results.”
        
    -   Users should feel they can switch between exploration and exact lookup.
        
5.  **Multi-modal search**
    
    -   Support text, voice, and image queries.
        
    -   Image → product search is now expected in retail (Pinterest, Amazon, Google Lens).

### 🏆 Best-in-Class AI Search UX Patterns

-   **Google Search w/ AI Overview**
    
    -   Combines a generated summary on top with traditional results beneath (good fallback, avoids hallucination lock-in).
        
-   **Perplexity AI**
    
    -   Clear citations inline with generated answers.
        
    -   Quick refinement through “related questions.”
        
-   **Kagi Search**
    
    -   Transparency via result sources, ranking, and filtering.
        
    -   Gives the user a sense of _agency_ rather than a black box.
        
-   **E-commerce (Amazon, Shopify AI search)**
    
    -   Autocomplete + natural language (“show me comfy shoes for walking in Rome in summer”).
        
    -   Faceted filters still visible for precision.
        
-   **Enterprise Knowledge Bases (Notion AI, Glean)**
    
    -   Semantic retrieval (“find the latest Figma component docs from Micha”).
        
    -   Inline preview of results so you don’t lose context.
        

----------

### ⚡ Emerging UX Trends

-   **Conversational Search Agents**: Instead of a static results page, you “chat with your search.”
    
-   **Results as Cards, Not Links**: Rich previews, inline actions (open doc, copy code, compare).
    
-   **Personalized Ranking**: Search feels “yours” by remembering past queries, role, or context.
    
-   **Hybrid UX**: Mix **LLM answer → links → filters** to avoid over-trusting AI.
    

----------

👉 If you’re building or evaluating:

-   For **e-commerce**, the gold standard is **multi-modal input + AI summarization + traditional filters**.
    
-   For **knowledge/enterprise**, it’s **semantic search + conversational refinement + citation transparency**.
    
-   For **general web/assistant search**, it’s **summary + citations + fallback to traditional search results**.

Do you want me to **benchmark existing AI search UIs** (screenshots + UX notes, like Perplexity vs Google vs Notion) so you get a design-system style comparison?

What to ask stakeholder during set up mewting

###### ChatGPT said:

Got it — you’re kicking off a **setup meeting with stakeholders** (I assume for a new product, feature, or design system initiative). The goal in that meeting is to:

-   **Align on purpose and goals**
    
-   **Understand expectations**
    
-   **Surface risks/constraints early**
    
-   **Clarify success metrics**
    

Here’s a structured set of **questions you can ask stakeholders** in a setup meeting:

----------

### 🎯 Vision & Goals

-   What’s the core problem we’re solving with this initiative?
    
-   What does success look like for you (short-term and long-term)?
    
-   How does this connect to larger business or organizational goals?
    

----------

### 👥 Stakeholders & Users

-   Who are the main users or beneficiaries?
    
-   What pain points do they currently face?
    
-   Are there secondary audiences we should keep in mind?
    
-   Who are the decision-makers vs. advisors in this project?
    

----------

### 📊 Success & Metrics

-   How will we measure success (KPIs, adoption, satisfaction, cost savings)?
    
-   Is there a deadline or milestone this project needs to align with (e.g. release, audit, leadership review)?
    

----------

### ⚙️ Process & Collaboration

-   How do you prefer to be updated (reports, demos, workshops)?
    
-   How often should we check in?
    
-   Are there existing processes or tools we should follow (Jira, Confluence, design review rituals)?
    
-   Any known blockers (tech, legal, budget, resources)?
    

----------

### 📚 Context & History

-   Have we tried solving this before? What worked / didn’t work?
    
-   Are there existing research insights, analytics, or competitor benchmarks we should review?
    

----------

### 🔮 Risks & Concerns

-   What risks worry you the most (adoption, compliance, cost, technical complexity)?
    
-   What would make this project fail in your eyes?
    

----------

### 🧭 Wrap-up

-   If we could only achieve one thing with this project, what should it be?
    
-   Is there anything “unspoken” that we should know about the organization, politics, or history of similar projects?
    

----------

👉 Tip: don’t just make it an interrogation — frame it as a **shared exploration**, so stakeholders feel you’re building together.

Would you like me to **draft a stakeholder meeting template** (agenda + questions + space for notes) that you can reuse, almost like a playbook?
